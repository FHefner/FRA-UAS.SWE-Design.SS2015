1. Set-up your Git - username and E - Mail:
	git config --global user.name "Username"
	git config --global user.email "mail@example.com"
2. Clone a existing Git repository to your local storage:
	cd <DesiredDestination>
	git clone https://github.com/...
3. Copy all files you want to upload inside the downloaded repository
4. Change into that directory
5. Add all the files you just copied to the next commit:
	git add . (for current directory) or git add * (for all files)
6. Check, if git recognized everything the way you want:
	git status
7. If everything is ok, do the commit:
	git commit
8. An Editor (nano or vim) will launch and you should define a good commit message, something like: 
	"I did update <this_and_that>." or "I created <this_and_that> new."
9. Finaly do the upload:
	git push
10. If you later want to keep your local folder up-to-date, use:
	git pull
